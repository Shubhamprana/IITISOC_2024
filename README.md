# Air Instrument Project

Welcome to the Air Instrument Project! This innovative project leverages the power of Python and machine learning to create virtual versions of musical instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. With unique features like volume control through finger gestures, this project brings a new level of interactivity and fun to playing instruments. Explore the project and start playing your favorite instruments in the air!

## Features

- **Virtual Instruments**: Play piano, drums, and guitar without physical instruments.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume through finger gestures.
- **Interactive Interface**: Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Web Integration**: Access the project through our website for a seamless experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Air Instrument Project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yashdev35/AirInstrumentProjectIITISoc.git
    cd AirInstrumentProjectIITISoc
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**

    then run the app.py file which will redirect you to website and you can play instruments there

## Volume control
use two fingers thumb and index to control volume
in drums it also records as you play


## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The core language used for developing the project.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time computer vision and hand tracking.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand gesture recognition.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Flask**: For integrating the project with the web.
