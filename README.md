# Air-Guitar

Air-Guitar is a unique project, which allows you to simulate the experience of playing a guitar without actually having one. It uses hand detection technology to create an interactive and fun musical experience.

## Features

- **Hand Detection**: The application detects your hands and superimposes six virtual guitar strings on the screen.
- **String Sound**: When your index finger comes into contact with a string, the application plays the corresponding guitar string sound.
- **Song Playback**: The application can play songs. However, please note that string detection may not work well with very fast hand movements.

## Upcoming Features

- **Chord Implementation**: I am planning to implement chord functionality in the future. The groundwork for this feature has already been laid, and I am currently working on integrating it into the main project.

## Feedback

I welcome feedback on the Air-Guitar project. If you have a feature request, bug report, or any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue.
